# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 8th, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

### Day 2: March 9th, Saturday 

**Today's Progress**: I started Free Code Camp's curiculim today. I am half way through the first progject. This project is teaching me HTML and creating a website. 

**Thoughts** I never thought bout learning HTML but its not that bad. I also can see why I should have learnt this. There are times where I would open up a websites code by mistake and now I can atleast understand the formating and what activates certain actions. I have so much more to learn. Can't wait.

### Day 3: March 10th, Sunday 

**Today's Progress**: I finished my first project! I created a cat photo app.

**Thoughts** HTML can be very simple, and my app reminds me of the webpages back in the 2000s. I know there is much more customization to be utilized like the myspace pages. Maybe I can become fluent enough to create my own myspace theme. Next, I plan to put my code on my IDE and utilize AWS Q and AWS code whisper to see what recommendations it will have to improve my code.
