**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

### Day 2: March 9th, Saturday 

**Today's Progress**: I started Free Code Camp's curiculim today. I am half way through the first progject. This project is teaching me HTML and creating a website. 

**Thoughts** I never thought bout learning HTML but its not that bad. I also can see why I should have learnt this. There are times where I would open up a websites code by mistake and now I can atleast understand the formating and what activates certain actions. I have so much more to learn. Can't wait.
