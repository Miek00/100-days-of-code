## Log

### Day 1: March 8th, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Today, I started to set things up and connect my VS Code and Git to keep track of my progress. I followed the Git and GitHub for Beginners - Crash Course by freeCodeCamp.org on Youtube. 

**Thoughts** Starting with Git commands and terminal practice is a great because it will be something will be used in the future. It feels good to be back coding again. I have a lot to learn but I am excited. I want to work on vloggin my experience also through Youtube videos (in progress).
